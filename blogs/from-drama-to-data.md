Hi smart people,

I’m Timo, a software developer based in New York with one of the most bizarre backgrounds: Theater.

Yep. I studied theater during undergrad, and now I’m coding software with an artist’s heart. Wild, right?

## From Drama to Data

In 2020, the world fell apart. Restaurants closed. Theaters? Don’t even think about it. I was set to graduate into live performance—and ended up entering a global shutdown instead.

To top it off, around my birthday, I was hit by a car. I was bedridden for weeks. Thankfully, nothing fatal—but imagine going through MRIs and getting tubes stuck in your body to check if your bladder is bleeding. (Yeah. Not fun.)

Most 20-year-olds would binge mobile games to pass the time. But my hands didn’t work. So instead? I started learning AI.

No lie, I had no idea what I was doing. Andrew Ng started talking about F1 scores, and I thought, “Wait—is this Formula 1? Are we racing??”
And what the hell is a “String”? Why not just say “text”?!

Still, that experience sparked something. It was the first time I felt like I was using 100% of my brain.

## The Split Identity

In theater, there’s no “wrong” answer. I thrived in math and science too, but I was always praised for my creativity. My dad (a doctor) used to test me with logic puzzles, but when I got them wrong, it hit hard. So I leaned into what I could win at—creative work.

Fast-forward: I got an AI certification. Then an internship. Then a job as a data analyst. And eventually, I made it to the U.S. to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science.

But that imposter syndrome? Oh, it lingered.
I kept labeling myself as “the theater undergrad.” Like I had to apologize for not being born into compilers and Leetcode.

## Screw the Norm. Be the Exception.

Let me tell you something that changed me:

**People don’t hire the smartest. They hire who they want to work with.**

Yes, tech giants like Google might prefer algorithm gods. That’s fine. But not every company wants a robot. Some value empathy, design, and people who listen.

The truth is—I’m not a traditional engineer. I’m a vibrant, extroverted human being. For a while, I tried to suppress that to fit in with the “tech bro” culture.

But it sucked.

You’re not meant to dim your light just to look like everyone else. You’re made to be creative, to stand out, to bring color into rooms full of gray.

## There’s More Than One Tech Path

What I didn’t know when I first started this journey was: tech isn’t one monolith.

There are roles that blend creativity and logic, like:

- **Solution Architects** – half tech, half storytelling
- **User Experience Engineers** – focused on empathy and research
- **Technical Product Managers** – organizing chaos with vision

My hybrid background in tech and theater makes me a better communicator, collaborator, and problem-solver. It gives me an edge in non-traditional roles—and honestly, those are the ones I love most.

## Bridging Tech and Creativity: My AI Fashion Designer Project

In my latest project (04/2025), **AI Fashion Designer**, the connection between creativity and technology came full circle for me.  
The project felt incredibly personal. I used to study costume design and theater design—one of the greatest classes I’ve ever taken. It’s the kind of experience that sticks with you for life.

Today, AI has advanced so far that the bottleneck isn’t technical pain anymore—it’s creative originality. You can build an application in days or weeks, but will it be original? Not likely.

My prediction: people specializing purely in tech will start shifting toward roles that assist AI—like product managers, designers, or UX researchers.  
Creativity is becoming the new differentiator.

## Final Thoughts ...

Look, it’s tough out here. You basically need to solve world hunger to land a tech job in 2025.

But here’s my advice:

**Be creative. Be aggressive. Break doors. Make your own.**

Don’t wait for permission. Don’t wait to fit in.

You’re not just your degree. You’re your story. You’re your vibe. You’re your whole damn self.

If I could go back, I wouldn’t change a thing.
(Okay fine—I’d buy Bitcoin and sell high. But that’s it.)

**You got this. Go be weird. Go be brilliant.**
