# Why Every AI Will Use MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Hi smart people,

Back in mid-April, I went to a Generative AI event hosted by Amazon, not expecting much.  
Then they kept talking about Model Context Protocol (MCP) over and over.  
And I was like—what the hell is it, and why is everyone obsessed with it???

Turns out, MCP is like an adapter that lets your AI work with external applications.  
You could literally make Claude swipe Tinder for you.

That’s the gist of it—but you’re nerds. You want more. So let’s dive deeper.

## Debugging the Old Way

The problem:

Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate—a lot.  
But not the good kind of hallucination.  
The frustrating kind, where the model forgets why it even started solving your problem.

No matter how much you upgrade GPUs or memory, LLMs will always have this limitation because they rely on fragile train-of-thought chains.  
More hardware doesn’t fix human-like forgetfulness.

The optimization curve hits diminishing returns, hard.

## Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The solution:

Instead of forcing the model to remember everything…  
Why not provide it with the right context when it needs it?

MCP offloads memory and context management to external systems.

Think of it like:

- APIs let computers talk to computers  
- MCPs let AIs get live context from apps, databases, or even your fridge

Instead of cramming everything inside the model, you create a separate protocol that manages live information.

### Benefits:
- Huge reduction in hallucination  
- Cleaner, more modular AI systems  
- Easy to swap out app connections without rewriting core code  
- Better scaling for real-world workflows  

This isn’t a futuristic idea.  
It’s already happening.

Startups have been quietly using MCPs since November 2024 after Claude introduced early versions.  
Now it’s even creeping into OpenAI documentation.  
It’s real. It’s here. And if you want to ride the AI bullet train, you need to know this.

## Final Thought

MCP feels like one of those “how did we not do this before?” moments.

Learn it. Build with it. Stay ahead.

See you in the new world.
